Thinking about plotting the intersections between multiple sets? Stop using ~~venndiagram~~ and try [UpSetR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/UpSetR/vignettes/basic.usage.html). There are lots of powerful things you can do with it. For example, here I am plotting the presence and absence of mutations among multiple tumor samples from different regions of a colorectal tumor. Samples were taken from two broadly defined regions, A and B, within which both bulk and single-gland sampling are available. From the plot shown above, it can be seen that spatial segregation of somatic mutations is evident.

## Writing code blocks

There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, `like this`. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:

```
.my-link {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
```

## Full HTML

Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here's a standard YouTube embed code as an example:

<p><iframe style="width:100%;" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cniqsc9QfDo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
