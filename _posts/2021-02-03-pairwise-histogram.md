The idea in comparing VAF histograms above and below the axis for two samples was originally from [Andrea Sottoriva](https://www.icr.ac.uk/our-research/researchers-and-teams/professor-andrea-sottoriva), and I have made improvements on coloring the cloncal status of the variants, as well as on the adaptive binning based on the number of available variants. See examples in my paper exploring [the between-region genomic divergence](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3891).
